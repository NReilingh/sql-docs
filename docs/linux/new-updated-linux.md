# New and Recently Updated: SQL Server on Linux docs



Nearly every day Microsoft updates some of its existing articles on its [Docs.Microsoft.com](http://docs.microsoft.com/) documentation website. This article displays excerpts from recently updated articles. Links to new articles might also be listed.

This article is generated by a program that is rerun periodically. Occasionally an excerpt can appear with imperfect formatting, or as markdown from the source article. Images are never displayed here.

Recent updates are reported for the following date range and subject:



- *Date range of updates:* &nbsp; **2017-12-03** &nbsp; -to- &nbsp; **2018-02-03**
- *Subject area:* &nbsp; **Microsoft SQL Server on Linux**.

## Updated Articles with Excerpts

This section displays the excerpts of updates gathered from articles that have recently experienced a large update.

The excerpts displayed here appear separated from their proper semantic context. Also, sometimes an excerpt is separated from important markdown syntax that surrounds it in the actual article. Therefore these excerpts are for general guidance only. The excerpts only enable you to know whether your interests warrant taking the time to click and visit the actual article.

For these and other reasons, do not copy code from these excerpts, and do not take as exact truth any text excerpt. Instead, visit the actual article.

Automatic failover of an AG is possible when the following conditions are met:

-   The primary and the secondary replica are set to synchronous data movement.
-   The secondary has a state of synchronized (not synchronizing), meaning the two are at the same data point.
-   The cluster type is set to External. Automatic failover is not possible with a cluster type of None.
-   The `sequence_number` of the secondary replica to become the primary has the highest sequence number â€“ in other words, the secondary replica's `sequence_number` matches the one from the original primary replica.

If these conditions are met and the server hosting the primary replica fails, the AG will change ownership to a synchronous replica. The behavior for synchronous replicas (of which there can be three total: one primary and two secondary replicas) can further be controlled by `required_synchronized_secondaries_to_commit`. This works with AGs on both Windows and Linux, but is configured completely differently. On Linux, the value is configured automatically by the cluster on the AG resource itself.

**Configuration-only replica and quorum**


Also new in SQL Server 2017 as of CU1 is a configuration-only replica. Because Pacemaker is different than a WSFC, especially when it comes to quorum and requiring STONITH, having just a two-node configuration will not work when it comes to an AG. For an FCI, the quorum mechanisms provided by Pacemaker can be fine, because all FCI failover arbitration happens at the cluster layer. For an AG, arbitration under Linux happens in SQL Server, where all the metadata is stored. This is where the configuration-only replica comes into play.

Without anything else, a third node and at least one synchronized replica would be required. This would not work for SQL Server Standard, since it can only have two replicas participating in an AG. The configuration-only replica stores the AG configuration in the master database, same as the other replicas in the AG configuration. The configuration-only replica does not have the user databases participating in the AG. The configuration data is sent synchronously from the primary. This configuration data is then used during failovers, whether they are automatic or manual.

    ```
    SSIS_PACKAGE_DECRYPT=test /opt/ssis/bin/dtexec /f package.dtsx
    ```

2.  Specify the `/de[crypt]` option to enter the password interactively, as shown in the following example:

    ```
    /opt/ssis/bin/dtexec /f package.dtsx /de

    Enter decryption password:
    ```

3.  Specify the `/de` option to provide the password on the command line, as shown in the following example. This method is not recommended because it stores the decryption password with the command in the command history.

    ```
    opt/ssis/bin/dtexec /f package.dtsx /de test

    Warning: Using /De[crypt] <password> may store decryption password in command history.

    You can use /De[crypt] instead to enter interactive mode,
    or use environment variable SSIS_PACKAGE_DECRYPT to set decryption password.
    ```

**Design packages**


**Connect to ODBC data sources**. With SSIS on Linux CTP 2.1 Refresh and later, SSIS packages can use ODBC connections on Linux. This functionality has been tested with the SQL Server and the MySQL ODBC drivers, but is also expected to work with any Unicode ODBC driver that observes the ODBC specification. At design time, you can provide either a DSN or a connection string to connect to the ODBC data; you can also use Windows authentication. For more info, see the [blog post announcing ODBC support on Linux](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssis/2017/06/16/odbc-is-supported-in-ssis-on-linux-ssis-helsinki-ctp2-1-refresh/).
