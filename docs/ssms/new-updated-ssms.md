## Updated Articles with Excerpts

This section displays the excerpts of updates gathered from articles that have recently experienced a large update.

The excerpts displayed here appear separated from their proper semantic context. Also, sometimes an excerpt is separated from important markdown syntax that surrounds it in the actual article. Therefore these excerpts are for general guidance only. The excerpts only enable you to know whether your interests warrant taking the time to click and visit the actual article.

For these and other reasons, do not copy code from these excerpts, and do not take as exact truth any text excerpt. Instead, visit the actual article.

SSMS 17.4 is the latest version of SQL Server Management Studio. The 17.x generation of SSMS provides support for almost all feature areas on SQL Server 2008 through SQL Server 2017. Version 17.x also supports SQL Analysis Service PaaS.

Version 17.4 includes:

Vulnerability Assessment:
- Added a new SQL Vulnerability Assessment service to scan your databases for potential vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and exposed sensitive data.
- Results of the assessment include actionable steps to resolve each issue and customized remediation scripts where applicable. The assessment report can be customized for each environment and tailored to specific requirements. Learn more at [SQL Vulnerability Assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-vulnerability-assessment).

SMO:
- Fixed issue where *HasMemoryOptimizedObjects* was throwing exception on Azure.
- Added support for new CATALOG_COLLATION feature.

Always On Dashboard:
- Improvements for latency analysis in Availability Groups.
- Added two new reports: *AlwaysOn\_Latency\_Primary* and *AlwaysOn\_Latency\_Secondary*.

Showplan:
- Updated links to point to correct documentation.
- Allow single plan analysis directly from actual plan produced.
- New set of icons.
- Added support for recognize "Apply logical operators" like GbApply, InnerApply.

XE Profiler:
- Renamed to XEvent Profiler.
- Stop/Start menu commands now stop/start the session by default.
- Enabled keyboard shortcuts (for example, CTRL-F to search).
- Added database\_name and client\_hostname actions to appropriate events in XEvent Profiler sessions. For the change to take effect, you may need to delete existing QuickSessionStandard or QuickSessionTSQL session instances on the servers - [Connect 3142981](https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/3142981)
